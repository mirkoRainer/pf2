# PF2 App/Library

This is an ambitious attempt to take the rules from [Pathfinder Second Edition](https://paizo.com/pathfinder) and put them to code within a C#/.NET Library to then be packaged and available for consumption in other projects.

## Coding Guidelines

### DDD ([Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design))
This project is intended to be guided first and foremost by DDD.
Any player of PF2e should be able to read and follow the general idea of what the code is doing. This should make it easy to consume the library and also ensure all contributors are on the same page.
### TDD ([Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development))
While test may not be written first, they should be written before commits are made at the minimum.
Ideally, one of the more complex tests would complete an entire round of combat within PF2e to verify things are handled appropriately. 
### Fun
This is a hobby project so please have fun and don't be afraid to make mistakes in code. No one will lose money or fire you over it, especially since we have Git to help us reset things.
